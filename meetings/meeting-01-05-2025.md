## Item 1: Directory Structure

**Mika** has changed the directory structure on their local copy to fit what we have learnt in class. They will commit that to main once we complete other structural tasks, such as [Item 2](#item-2-database-schema).

## Item 2: Database Schema

As a group, we laid out a rough schema.
After the meeting, I created the following database schema:

```sql

/* Do we want to make a one-to-one relationship with targets, or do we want them all in one table? 
For now I have made it one large table tables. */

/* Perhaps some validation on emails within the DB schema? */ 

CREATE TABLE user (
    user_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    username TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    email TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    hashed_password NOT NULL,
    height INTEGER NOT NULL, /* change height in profile page? */
    target_weight REAL,
    target_weight_time_days INTEGER,
    target_exercise_time_per_week INTEGER,
    target_exercise_timeframe_days INTEGER
);

/* Validate calories so they can only be filled in if their respective breakfast, lunch and dinner sections are filled in.*/

CREATE TABLE daily_record (
    record_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    date DATE NOT NULL,
    weight INTEGER NOT NULL,
    breakfast TEXT,
    breakfast_calories INTEGER,
    lunch TEXT,
    lunch_calories INTEGER,
    dinner TEXT,
    dinner_calories INTEGER
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES user(user_id)
);

/* Note the lower case on the CHECK. */

CREATE TABLE daily_exercise (
    exercise_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    record_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    exercise_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    exercise_duration_minutes INTEGER NOT NULL,
    exercise_intensity TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (status IN ('light', 'moderate', 'intense'))
    FOREIGN KEY (record_id) REFERENCES daily_record(record_id)
)

```

This schema will also be posted to Issue #4 so that we can discuss further about the database if necessary.

## Item 3: Visualise Data Section

>### Report 1: Weight Analysis

---

We decided as a group that the following basic features would be included in the weight analysis report:
1. A line graph showing weight change. Obtain weight data for a single user, order by date and create graph.
> Extension: Allow user to toggle between a 7 day, 1 month, 3 month, 6 month, 1 year and lifetime graph. (or some other set of times)
2. Have a BMI graphic. Take current weight and height from database.
3. Have a weight target goal graphic. Take most recent entry of weight and target weight from database.
4. Have a short, encouraging insight into their current weight trend. Requires analysis of their weight changes.

---

>### Report 2: Habits Analysis

---

1. Use the exercise type, length and intensity, put it into an AI API and find the calories burnt (?).
2. Determine via their weight goal whether they want to put on or take off weight, and decide from their food intake whether they can or cannot with current eating habits.
3. Predict how long it will take to achieve their weight and exercise goals with current trends.

---

## Item 4: Share Data Section

Will include the following:
- A friends list
    - Search user functionality
    - Send friend requests and accept them
    - See profile (unknown what is in this profile yet, discuss later if we have time).
- Generate and Share reports with Friends
    - You can send friends an email with your report.
    > Extension: Share specific graphs or statistics with friends, rather than the whole thing.
