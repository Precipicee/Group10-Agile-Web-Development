Group 10's Agile Web Development Project: FitTrack

## Rundown of our Project

Our project aimed to create a simple, easy-to-use fitness tracker web application. 

It holds data for weight and exercise habits, and provides graphical output based on a person's progression.

The app is intended to be used once per day, and as such a user can only enter data for a given day once.

Once a user uploads data, we provide insights and analysis on their current capacities.

## Running the Application Server

To get the server to run, simply run the `run.sh` file.

If there is a permission denied output, make it executable using `chmod +x run.sh`.

By default, it will run the server on `localhost:5000`.

## Tutorial of the Website

After getting the server to run and reaching the homepage on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`, you will be greeted with the `Home` page.

On this homepage, you can ___.

In the navigation bar at the top of the screen, there initially appears three tabs: `Home`, `About` and `Sign In`.

> Home is the page we are currently on.

> About includes a brief introduction to our website.

> Sign In takes you to the sign-in page, where you can either sign-in or choose to sign-up.

Once creating an account using the `Sign Up` page, you must fill in some preliminary information.

Once this information is filled out, you will be taken to the `Data Page`, which allows you to choose if you want to add data (the `Upload Data` portion of the project), or view reports (the `Visualise Data` section). New tabs in the navigation bar will now be included: `Entry` and `Reports`.
